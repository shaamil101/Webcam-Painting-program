# Webcam-Painting-program
## The goal is to build a webcam-based painting program in which some portion of the image (say your hand, or a marker tip) acts as a "paintbrush".

### The core computational problem is to identify the paintbrush in the webcam image. Here we base the recognition solely on color, so it should have a fairly uniform and distinct color. For example, I could wear a dark blue shirt and do torso-based painting, or I could use the green cap of a marker and more delicately paint something. (Both such "paintbrushes" below are recolored to distinguish them.)
